# How to format?

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) uses **Markdown** to format _text_. Find out more on how to format [Markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

The hugo book theme enables the use of [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) diagrams ...

{{< mermaid >}}
stateDiagram-v2
idea --> prototype: ðŸ› 
{{< /mermaid >}}

... and [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) math typesetting.

{{< katex >}}
e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0
{{< /katex >}}

```python
print("Format code in your Markdown file.")
```

Try to always add a descriptive caption to an included image. Also make sure images are not unnecessarily large.

You can also embed videos. For more details see the [hugo-video](https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-video) theme component.

More details on how to use the Hugo book theme can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

You can also create:

- unordered lists
- and tables:

| Milestone |         Date |
| :-------- | -----------: |
| ~~Idea~~  | ~~1.1.1979~~ |
| New idea  |     2.1.1979 |
| Prototype |     3.1.1979 |

Also task lists can be formatted:

- [x] Prototype
- [ ] Documentation
